          model_filter:   if using out-of-box pretrain models,
                          identify class number for traffic light.
                          i.e. For models trained with coco dataset, TL class is 10. Light color will be determined using CV methods
                          if using re-trained models (transfer learning), set to -1.

         min_score:       mininimum score of detected class to be considered valid detection

         TL_color_method: if model_filter is not set to -1, we typically would use the class information for color
                          1 - if we are using pre-determine image processing
                          2 - if we want to count the detected classes

         roi_width:       Width of ROI to run detection on input image. In pixel units

         roi_height:      Height of ROI to run detection on input image. In pixel units

         image_adjust:     Switch on/off any pre-determined image adjustments to help with detection
